- Restassured: I opted for Restassured because it is a Java library that is easy to use and has a lot of features that make it easy to test REST APIs. It is also easy to integrate with other Java libraries and frameworks. The community around Restassured is also very active, which means that there are a lot of resources available to help you get started with the library.It supports Gherkin style BDD syntax which makes it easy to write test cases in a human-readable format. 

- Spotless: I chose Spotless because it is a code formatter that helps to keep the codebase clean and consistent. It is easy to configure and integrates well with Gradle. It also has a lot of features that make it easy to customize the formatting rules to suit your project's needs. I've configured it to use Google's Java style guide.

- Github actions: I chose Github actions because it is a CI/CD tool that is easy to use and integrates well with Github. It is also free for public repositories, which makes it a good choice for open-source projects. I've configured it to run the tests on every push to the main branch.

- JUnit: I chose JUnit because it is a popular testing framework for Java that is easy to use and has a lot of features that make it easy to write and run tests. It is also easy to integrate with other Java libraries and frameworks. I've configured it to generate reports in XML format.
